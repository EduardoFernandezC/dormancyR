# dormancyR

`dormancyR` aims to provide alternatives to common chill models used in
horticulture to compute chill metrics in deciduous fruit tree orchards.
The package produces outputs compatible with the `chillR` package
(Luedeling 2019). It also contains functions to handle historic and
updated weather data downloaded from Chilean (Center for Climate and
Resilience Research - <https://www.cr2.cl>; Agromet INIA -
<https://www.agromet.cl/datos-historicos>) and German databases (Climate
Data Center - <https://cdc.dwd.de/portal/>).

`dormancyR` was developed for a scientific manuscript
