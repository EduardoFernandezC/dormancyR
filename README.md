# alternative_chill_functions
R functions for the eduaRdo package. This package contains functions to estimate chill metrics according to alternative models. Most of the functions are compatible with the "chillR" package (Luedeling, 2018). It also contains a function to handle historic Chilean weather data downloaded from the Center for Climate and Resilience Research (www.cr2.cl).
