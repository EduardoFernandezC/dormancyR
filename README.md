# alternative\_chill\_functions

R functions for the alternative\_chill\_functions package. It contains
functions to estimate chill metrics according to alternative
horticultural and forest chill models. Most of the functions are
compatible with the “chillR” package (Luedeling, 2018). It also contains
functions to handle historic Chilean weather data downloaded from the
Center for Climate and Resilience Research (www.cr2.cl) and current data
downloaded from the Chilean Agromet website
(<https://www.agromet.cl/datos-historicos>). Finally, this package also
contains a function to download weather data from the German Climate
Data Center (<https://cdc.dwd.de/portal/>). This package was used in a
scientific manuscript which is now under review.
