# dormancyR

`dormancyR` aims to provide alternatives to common chill models used in
horticulture to  
compute chill metrics in deciduous fruit tree orchards as well as
functions to handle  
weather data. The package produces outputs compatible with the `chillR`
package  
(Luedeling 2020). It also contains functions to handle historic ([Center
for Climate and Resilience Research](https://www.cr2.cl)) and up-to-date
([Agromet INIA](https://www.agromet.cl/datos-historicos)) weather data
downloaded from  
Chilean databases. `dormancyR` also contains weather data from a German
database  
([Climate Data Center](https://cdc.dwd.de/portal/)).

`dormancyR` was developed for a scientific manuscript DOIâ€¦
