\title{Growing degree hours model for base temperature of 10 celsius degree}
\usage{
GDH_10(HourTemp, summ = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{HourTemp}{Vector of hourly temperatures}

\item{summ}{Boolean parameter to add the cumulative sum as output}
}
\description{
Modification of the actual model developed to quantify the heat between two periods. In this case the
function computes the metric by using as base temperature 10 celsius degree instead of 4 celsius degree 
as the original model.
}
\examples{
 

GDH_10(sample(c(1 : 30), 100, replace = TRUE), summ = TRUE)
