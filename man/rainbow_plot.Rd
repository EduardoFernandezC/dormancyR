\title{Visualizing phenology response to temperatures during two phases}
\usage{
rainbow_plot(
  pheno_data,
  weather_data,
  split_month = 6,
  chilling_phase,
  forcing_phase,
  Krig_warn = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pheno_data}{is a data frame that contains information on the timing of phenological events by year.
It should consist of two columns called `Year` and `pheno`. Data in the `pheno` column should be in
Julian date (day of the year)}

\item{weather_data}{is a dataframe containing daily minimum and maximum temperature data (in columns
called `Tmin` and `Tmax`, respectively). There also has to be a column for `Year` and one for `JDay`
(the Julian date, or day of the year). Alternatively, the date can also be given in three columns
(`Year`, `Month` and `Day`)}

\item{split_month}{is an integer representing the last month of the growing season. This procedure analyzes
data by phenological year, which can start and end in any month during the calendar year (currently only
at the beginning of a month). This variable indicates the last month (e.g. 5 for May) that should be
included in the record for a given phenological year. All subsequent months are assigned to the 
following phenological year.}

\item{chilling_phase}{is a vector of integers representig the start and end for the chilling period
in temperate trees. Numbers must be provided in Julian date (day of the year).}

\item{forcing_phase}{is a vector of integers representig the start and end for the forcing period
in temperate trees. Numbers must be provided in Julian date (day of the year).}

\item{Krig_warn}{is a boolean parameter passed to the \code{\link[fields:Krig]{Krig}} function. Default is
set `TRUE` following the recomendation of the authors. For detailed information, please see the documentation
of the function.}
}
\value{
`rainbow_plot()` is expected to return a plot as the following

\figure{rainbow_plot_example.png}{options: align='bottom' width='100\%' alt='rainbow_plot example'}
}
\description{
The timing of many developmental stages of temperate trees may depend on temperatures during two
phases (e.g. bloom dates depend on the temperature during both the chilling and forcing phase of dormancy).
`rainbow_plot()` illustrates this dependency as a colored surface with contour lines by applying an
interpolating procedure with functions in the \code{\link{fields}} package. The plot is implemented
through functions in the \code{\link{ggplot2}} package.
}
\details{
The generation of the color surface is based on the Kriging technique, which is typically used for 
interpolation of spatial data. The use for this particular purpose is a bit experimental.

\examples{
 
rainbow_plot(pheno_data = chillR::KA_bloom,
             weather_data = chillR::KA_weather,
             chilling_phase = c(306, 350),
             forcing_phase = c(355, 60))
