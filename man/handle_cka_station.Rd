\title{Get weather data from Campus Klein Altendorf in \code{\link{chillR}} format}
\usage{
handle_cka_station(
  folder_path,
  vars = c("Temp"),
  time_step = "hourly",
  check_data = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder_path}{Character string. This is the complete directory name where the files are stored}

\item{vars}{Character string. Variables of interest returned by the function. These are:
\emph{"Wind_speed"} (m/s), \emph{"Wind_direction"} (degrees), \emph{"Temp"} (Celsius), \emph{"Tmean"} (Celsius), \emph{"Tmax"} (Celsius),
\emph{"Tmin"} (Celsius), \emph{"Humidity"} (%), \emph{"Above_Ground_Temp"} (Celsius), \emph{"Soil_Temp"} (Celsius), \emph{"Precipitation"} (mm),
\emph{"Radiation"} (W/m2) and \emph{"PAR"} (umol/m2/s). Default is set to temperature (\emph{"Temp"})}

\item{time_step}{Character string. This is related to the frequency in which the data was recorded. Normally,
CKA records weather parameters each 10 min. However, this function summarizes values into \emph{hourly} and 
\emph{daily} basis. Default is set to \emph{hourly}}

\item{check_data}{Boolean parameter to define whether the data should be quality checked or not. This means to
look for missing hours or days and fill them through linear interpolation. This only works for temperature
records}
}
\description{
This function allows to handle weather data recorded by the weather station located in Campus Klein Altendorf
in Rhineland, Germany. Normally, the access to the data is restricted to CKA stuff but, any person could ask
for it at: \url{https://www.cka.uni-bonn.de/forschung/wetterdaten/aktuelle-wetterdaten}. It is important to note that
CKA has the data organized into daily ".csv" files for the recent period as well as in ".zip" files for each year.
This function only works for data downloaded and extracted as csv files into one common folder. This means, all the files 
need to be in the same folder, independent of the year. The function returns the most important variables for
agricultural production. Among these, temperature, rainfall, wind speed, PAR, among others.
}
\details{
It is important to note that the data has to be downloaded by hand from the website or requested to the stuff
working at CKA. The output is a data frame useful for further analysis with \code{\link{chillR}} or this package.
The interpolation in \code{check_data} is made by using some functions contained in the \code{\link{chillR}} package. \emph{Tmin}, \emph{Tmean} and \emph{Tmax}
only work for \emph{daily} time step and \emph{Temp} only does for \emph{hourly} time step.

\examples{

# As each user has different path for the folder this example is not running until "#"
# is removed

# path <- "C:/Users/...../...."

# handle_cka_station(folder_path = path, vars = c("Tmin", "Tmean", "Tmax"),
# time_step = "daily", check_data = T)
