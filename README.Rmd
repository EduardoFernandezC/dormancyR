# dormancyR

`dormancyR` aims to provide alternatives to common chill models used in horticulture to  
compute chill metrics in deciduous fruit tree orchards as well as functions to handle  
weather data. The package produces outputs compatible with the `chillR` package  
[@R-chillR]. It also contains functions to handle historic ([Center for Climate and Resilience Research](<https://www.cr2.cl>)) and up-to-date ([Agromet INIA](<https://www.agromet.cl/datos-historicos>)) weather data downloaded from  
Chilean databases. `dormancyR` also contains weather data from a German database  
([Climate Data Center](<https://cdc.dwd.de/portal/>)).

`dormancyR` was developed for a scientific manuscript DOI...
