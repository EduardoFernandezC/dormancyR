# dormancyR

`dormancyR` aims to provide alternatives to common chill models used in horticulture to compute chill metrics in deciduous fruit tree orchards. The package produces outputs compatible with the `chillR` package [@R-chillR]. It also contains functions to handle historic and updated weather data downloaded from Chilean databases (<https://www.cr2.cl>, <https://www.agromet.cl/datos-historicos>). Finally, `dormancyR` also contains a function to obtain weather data from the German Climate Data Center (<https://cdc.dwd.de/portal/>).

`dormancyR` was developed for a scientific manuscript
